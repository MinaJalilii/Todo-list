# Todo List

This Todo List project is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Built
with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features an intuitive interface that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks
seamlessly. This project demonstrates the practical application of basic web development techniques, including DOM
manipulation and event handling, to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their todo list.
- **View Tasks**: All added tasks are displayed in a list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks once they are completed or no longer needed.
